# Deployed Personal Portfolio By Riley Newhart

## In this web application you will find my most up to date projects, an about section
## of myself, a personal resume, and information on how to contact me.

- With this portfolio you will be able to see what my strengths are as a software
developer and see what I am improving on in real time as I update my projects.

- Upon the deployment of this portfolio project it will be easily accessible for employers or
other developers to view my work and reach out to me. 

- When creating this portfolio it very much tested my skills in CSS. My problem solving skills
have heavily increased since I have learned how to think like a developer and gain that mindset
of computational thinking.
